Status: Canonical  
Version: v1.0

This glossary defines terms used across all Mbongo Chain documents, specifications, and the whitepaper.

---

## A

### AIDA (Autonomous Intelligent Dynamic Adjuster)
Bounded, deterministic economic regulator controlling burn rate, fee multipliers, and compute market balancing. Cannot modify supply, emission, or consensus-critical rules.

### Account
An entity with an address, balance, nonce, and optional staking & governance properties.

---

## B

### Base Fee
Minimum gas price required for a transaction, adjusted dynamically by AIDA.

### Block Reward
Native MBO issued per block: initial 0.1 MBO per second, halving every 5 years.

### Burn
Permanent removal of MBO via AIDA-regulated transaction fee destruction.

---

## C

### C-Gas (Compute Gas)
Gas consumed for PoUW compute tasks (AI inference, rendering, ZK proving). Billed independently from E-Gas.

### Compute Node
A GPU/TPU/NPU/CPU operator executing PoUW jobs and producing receipts.

### Consensus (PoX)
Hybrid model combining PoS, PoUW, and PoC.

---

## D

### DAO
Decentralized governance body responsible for upgrades, treasury decisions, and network parameters.

---

## E

### E-Gas (Execution Gas)
Gas consumed by regular state transitions: transfers, staking, governance, and module execution.

### Emission Schedule
Fixed reward schedule: block reward halves every 157,680,000 blocks.

---

## F

### Founder Council
A 10-year temporary governance layer with veto authority over critical protocol changes.

### Fraud Proof
Proof submitted to challenge invalid PoUW results.

---

## G

### Gas Limit
Maximum gas allowed per transaction or block.

### Governance Proposal
Formal request to change network parameters or upgrade the protocol.

---

## H

### Hardware Attestation (PoC)
Mechanism validating compute hardware identity & capability.

---

## M

### Marketplace (PoUW)
Decentralized compute marketplace for distributing workloads to compute nodes.

---

## P

### PoC (Proof-of-Compute)
Attestation verifying hardware class, performance, and identity.

### PoS (Proof-of-Stake)
Consensus mechanism relying on stake-weighted validators.

### PoUW (Proof-of-Useful-Work)
Execution of useful GPU/TPU/NPU workloads verified by VWP receipts.

---

## R

### Receipt (Execution)
Record containing gas used, exit status, logs, and PoUW results.

### Redundancy
Execution of identical tasks by multiple compute nodes to detect inconsistencies.

---

## S

### Slashing
Penalty applied to malicious validators or compute nodes.

### SMT (Sparse Merkle Tree)
Data structure used to compute deterministic state roots.

### Stake
Amount of MBO locked for validator participation.

---

## T

### Tokenomics
Monetary rules of MBO: fixed supply (31,536,000 MBO), emission, burn, and reward split.

---

## V

### VWP (Validatable Work Proof)
Cryptographic proof generated by compute nodes proving task execution correctness.

---

## W

### WASM Runtime (Future)
Deterministic contract execution environment planned for future network upgrades.
