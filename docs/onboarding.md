# Contributor Onboarding (Phase 2)

## Step 1: Read Documentation

- Read [README.md](../README.md) for project overview
- Read [recruitment.md](./recruitment.md) to identify your contribution circle
- Review [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines

## Step 2: Pick an Issue

- Browse GitHub issues labeled `phase-2`
- Choose an issue that matches your skills
- Comment on the issue to claim it

## Step 3: Fork and Work

- Fork the repository
- Clone your fork
- Create a branch from `dev` (not `main`)
- Make your changes
- Test locally

## Step 4: Open Pull Request

- Push your branch to your fork
- Open a pull request targeting the `dev` branch
- Fill out the PR template
- Label your PR with `phase-2`

## Step 5: Review Process

- Core team reviews only Rust core protocol PRs
- Other PRs are reviewed by relevant maintainers
- Address feedback promptly
- PRs are merged to `dev` after approval

## Rules

- **No direct commits to `main`**: `main` is protected and reserved for stable milestones
- **No protocol changes without approval**: Core protocol changes require Circle 1 (Rust core team) review
- **Ask questions publicly**: Use GitHub Issues or Discussions for questions. Do not use private channels for technical discussions.

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation in `docs/`
- Search GitHub Issues and Discussions
- Open a new Discussion for questions
- Tag maintainers in your PR if you need guidance
